# PhoenixMiner secondary coin (dual-ming) pools list

# The pools specified in this file will be added to the pools specified with the PhoenixMiner's
# command-line options (see -dpool command line option).
# 
# Alternatively, you can omit the -dpool option on the command-line and use only the pools in
# dpools.txt file. In such case you must add the option
#   -dcoin blake2s
# to your command-line or to your config.txt file
#
# You must put one pool per line as specified in the examples below
# If the line starts with '#' it will be ignored as comment
#
# NOTE: PhoenixMiner also "understands" the dpools.txt files from Claymore's dual Ethereum miner
